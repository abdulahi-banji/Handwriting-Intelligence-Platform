# Contributing


## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
2. Keep changes small and focused; one feature or fix per branch/PR.
3. Follow the coding style used in the repo. Format JS with Prettier and Python with Black/ruff where appropriate.
4. Write tests for new behavior (recommended). Add backend tests with `pytest` and frontend tests with your preferred framework.
5. Push your branch and open a pull request with a clear description and testing instructions.

## Commit message format

Use concise, meaningful commit messages. Example:



## Reviewing and merging

- Include screenshots or API examples for UI or API changes.
- Ensure CI passes (lint/tests). If no CI exists, run local linters and tests before requesting review.
